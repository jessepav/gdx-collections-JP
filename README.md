# gdx-collections-JP

A variant of [`gdx-collections`](https://github.com/mini2Dx/gdx-collections) with a simpler build
system, and a Java 7 target.

From `gdx-collections`:

> [LibGDX](https://libgdx.com/) [collection classes](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Collections)
> extracted into a standalone library (i.e. no OpenGL, LWJGL, etc. required)
> 
> This is useful for those who need high performance collections on the JVM but aren't building an
> application with LibGDX.
